I have successfully made active contributions to two major projects under the guidance of my university professor. I have also been a part of an app development workshop in my 2nd year and have completed a front end developer course and a few foreign language courses throughout my B Tech years. I also have a keen passion for reading young adult psychology novels by contemporary writers. In my free time I also pursue art and music at times. In my 5th semester I was also a part of a winter internship program by HighRadius Corporation where I learnt MySQL and worked for 4 months as a business analyst in the sales department, which helped me develop proactive communication skills required in the corporate world.</p></td>
